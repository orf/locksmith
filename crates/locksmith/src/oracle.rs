    /// It is non-trivial to understand exactly what impacts a given SQL statement has on a
    /// Postgres database. This is because the actual effects of a statement depend almost entirely
    /// on the *current* state of the database (including the version), which is not present in the
    /// statement itself. The statement is completely devoid of any context, and the context is
    /// the only thing that matters.
    ///
    /// For example, an `ALTER COLUMN` statement on a large table will either:
    /// - Require a lengthy rewrite of the entire table, during which no other operations can
    ///   be performed on the table *at all*, resulting in potential service disruption
    /// - Be an instantaneous metadata-only operation that does not block any other operations
    ///   on the table and requires no data to be rewritten.
    ///
    /// Which of these two outcomes occurs depends on the current type of the column and the
    /// type we are altering:
    /// - if the column is "binary compatible" with the new type then the operation is metadata-only
    /// - otherwise it requires a full rewrite.
    ///
    /// Which types are binary compatible is often an implementation specific detail of the  Postgres
    /// version in use, or in the case of custom data types the implementation of the type itself.
    ///
    /// In order to understand the impact of a statement, we need to execute it in a controlled
    /// environment and observe the side effects. This is what this method does: it provides a
    /// "query oracle" that executes the statements and observes the side effects. This
    /// relies entirely on Postgres' introspection capabilities as well as it's ability to execute
    /// DDL statements (such as `ALTER TABLE`) in a transaction, meaning it is generic across all
    /// supported Postgres versions, data types and extensions.
    ///
    /// # Detecting locks
    ///
    /// Postgres provides no built-in way to detect which tables a statement is trying to access,
    /// or what locks are required. In order to work around this, we force a controlled lock conflict
    /// using multiple transactions in a way that allows us to view the blocking locks. This gives
    /// us information on the specific tables and lock types that the query requires.
    ///
    /// Specifically, we use the following algorithm:
    /// 1. A new "locker" connection is created, and a transaction is begun
    /// 2. The locker connection locks all tables present in the database with an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
    ///    lock. This prevents all other transactions from performing any operations on the tables.
    /// 3. A new "executor" connection is created, and a transaction is begun
    /// 4. The executor executes the statement we are inspecting. This will cause the transaction
    ///    to be blocked by the "locker" connection.
    /// 5. When the executor detects that the statement is blocked it yields control back to the
    ///    oracle, whilst keeping the blocked transaction open in it's blocked state.
    /// 6. The "locker" connection then lists all locks that are blocking the executor's transaction,
    ///    which reveals the tables that the statement is trying to access. We now have an
    ///    initial set of tables that the statement is accessing.
    /// 7. We close the "executor" connection _without_ committing the transaction, and close the
    ///    "locker" connection after. This releases the locks on the tables.
    /// 8. We repeat steps 1 to 7, but this time only locking the tables that have *not* been
    ///    locked in the previous iterations. This allows us to detect new locks that the statement
    ///    is trying to acquire.
    /// 9. We repeat this process until the statement is no longer blocked by any locks and executes
    ///    successfully.
    ///
    /// Once this process is completed, we have observed the complete set of locks that the statement
    /// requires in order to execute.
    ///
    /// One caveat of this approach is that it is only really suitable to be run in a controlled,
    /// isolated instance of Postgres (i.e. not a production environment), and so it requires the
    /// schema to completely match the production schema in order to give accurate results.
    ///
    /// # Detecting other effects
    ///
    /// In addition to detecting locks, we also need to detect the other side effects of the
    /// statement. These include the specific objects that are added, removed, or modified, as well
    /// as any tables that are rewritten.
    ///
    /// The implementation of this is much simpler: we simply introspect relevant database objects
    /// *before* and *after* the statement is executed, and compare the two sets of objects.
